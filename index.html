<p>The bubble shooter game with 3 difficulty modes. Developed in Qt Creator </p>

<p>Playing Modes:
    Novice- you are allowed to miss (not connect 3 or more same coloured bubbles) 5 times before a new line is added.
    Expert- you are allowed to miss 3 times before a new line is added.
    Master- you are allowed to miss 3 times before a new line is added. However, you only have 5 seconds to take your turn. If the 5 seconds are up, your bubble is automatically shot.</p>

<p>Notes:
    You can click help to learn how to play the game.
    A text file will be created to keep track of the top ten high scores. This file will open at the beginning of every game. You can also open it by clicking the button.</p>
